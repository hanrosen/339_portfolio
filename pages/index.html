      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <img src="../me.jpeg" alt=""/>
      <p>Hi! Welcome to my Ann Arbor Review. I created this site as a platform to share my Ann Arbor favorites. But first, let me tell you a little bit about me. My name is Hannah Rosenbaum and I am currently a senior at the University of Michigan. I have spent basically all of the last four years living and breathing Ann Arbor and trying to find my spot as a local.<br><br>On each page of this site, I share my all-time favorites for three different categories: restaurants, bars and coffeeshops. But, if you don't have time to look through the whole site, don't worry because I've given a taste of my reviews below, with my #1 favorite of each category.</p>

      <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
      <div class = "restaurants">
        <img src="../restaurants/aventura/aventura4.png" alt=""/>
        <p>While a hard decision, if I had to determine my favorite restaurant in Ann Arbor, I think that I would choose Aventura. I did not actually try Aventura until Junior year but it quickly became my go-to spot whenever my parents come to town.</p>

      <h2>Favorite Coffeeshop</h2>
      <div class = 'coffeeshops'>
        <img src="../coffeeshops/blackdiesel/diesel4.png" alt=""/>
        <p>As a student, I spend a lot of my time in coffeeshops doing homework. The coffeeshop I find the most comforting is Black Diesel. This off-campus cafe has become a safe-haven for me when I need to escape campus and do some work.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Favorite Bar</h2>
      <div class = 'bars'>
        <img src="../bars/charleys/charleys3.png" alt=""/>
        <p>My favorite bar in Ann Arbor is Good Time Charley's. Their weekly Wednesday trivia is a favorite among my friends and we are the first in line at 8:30 to get our normal booth in the back.</p>

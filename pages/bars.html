			<h2>Bars</h2>
			<p> While there are many bars that my friends and I like to go to in Ann Arbor other than Good Time Charley's, there are two that we really like best. These two bars are Ricks and Nightcap. While both of those bars have a completely different vibe, it is nice to have places to go that serve different purposes.</p>

		<div class = "ricks_text">
			<h2>Ricks</h2>
			<p>Ricks is a college bar on Church St. that my friends go to on Friday nights. It is spacious and lively, and we go there for the dancing rather than for the drinks. This is a spot where I can always count on seeing everyone I know on campus on a Friday and can always count on having a good time.</p>

			<h2>Nightcap</h2>
			<p>Nightcap is a relatively newish bar on campus that my friends and I only discovered first semester. The vibe is completely different than Ricks as there is no dancing, but room for conversation. The drinks are amazing and if I go to Nightcap, I know that I need to be prepared to spend a bit of money, but think it is worth it for the delicious drink.</p>
